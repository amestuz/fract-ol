# fract-ol
42 Scholl project repository

The first graphical projects at 42 school.

Fract-ol generates beautiful fractals from the complex numbers of an iterative mathematical construct. 
A fractal is a fragmented geometrical figure that infinitely repeats itself at smaller scales. 

3 set of fractals hve been implemented: mandelbrot, julia and mandelbrot_invers.


This project uses the school's graphical library, MiniLibX.
